# Host Machine Setup

1.	The first step is to set up the website.  To do so we will use and Apache 2 server running on the Kali Linux Host virtual machine with the IP address * 192.168.166.201 *
 This can be done by running `service apache2 start`

2. This creates a simple webpage.  The index.html can be changed in the Apache2 directory

3. This concludes the host machine's initial setup.  This is a barebones web page, so feel free to add whatever details you want
